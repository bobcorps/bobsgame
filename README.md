**ok** is a multiplayer puzzle game- but not just any puzzle game, **EVERY puzzle game!** It's a build-your-own puzzle game with a puzzle game creator where YOU define all the rules to your own custom game!

More than that, great care has been made to ensure that **ok** is the *best* version of every puzzle game. I went through every puzzle game forum and wiki I could find and made sure to implement every detail and feature required by tournament level hardcore players. It has wall kicks, floor kicks, spin kicks, T-spins, adjustable timing, powerups, you name it. All of these features apply to all the games however you want, making it the best version of every game!

**ok** change in real time as you play it, morphing from game to game and making every round completely unique. Or you can choose to play just your favorite game type against your friends with fantastic controls, super tight timing, and features and powerups from other games.

**ok** is completely customizable, allowing the player to create in-depth rulesets to mimic existing puzzle games or create entirely new ones to add to the online library.

Create your own puzzle modes! Invent custom rulesets or challenge your friends to a sequence of all your favorite games. Compete in an online world championship and improve your skills to reach the top of the public leaderboard.

**ok** is constantly evolving with new theme packs, new rules, and user-designed puzzle packs.

**ok** currently supports as many local or network players as you want, mixed local/network multiplayer, Facebook integration, game controller support, and more.

The source code is available on GitHub so it can grow into a standard tournament platform for all puzzle games!

**ok is not done- it's quite playable, but I am actively adding many more features.**

* Lots more game mode features, modes, and goals
* Better multiplayer lobby with chat
* Tournament features and ladders, regional and global
